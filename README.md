# synapsBot
This is just a personal bot for my server. I hope you can figure out what my code does. Feel welcome to contact me on Discord @Mehvix#7172 


If you keep getting an error code when trying to write to the `users.json` file it's probably because you have multiple versions of the same bot running at the same time.
